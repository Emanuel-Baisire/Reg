<p>The purporse of this study is to compare fuel consumption of an automatic and manual transmission car in relation to Miles Per Gallon (MPG). The data source for this excercise is primarily from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine "mtcars" dataset. A regressiona model is applied to determine a better fuel efficiency transmission between a manual and automatic car.
The hypothesis to be tested is whether a manual transmission engine has a better Miles Per Gallon (Mpg) consumption than automatic. The test results indicated that a manual transmission engine has an MPG advantage of 7.2449 using a simple linear regression
To ensure that confouding variables do not skew the result, a Mulitvariate Regression was also conducted for a better view of transmission differences in relation to MPGS.
Overall, that study concludes that a manual transmission engine fare better than an automatic transmission relation to fuel consumption.

<h2>Load and Test Data<h2/>
<p>The initial step is to load and categorize data from the Motor Trend magazine dataset.</p>

<!--data(mtcars)
 str(mtcars)
-->

<h2>Process Data:<h2/>
<p>To proceed, we will have to convert some variables from nummeric to factors for a better analysis.</p>


<!--mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am,labels=c('Automatic','Manual'))
-->
<h2>Exploratory analysis<h2/>

<!--summary(mtcars)-->

<h2>Creating a Regression Model:<h2/>

<!--fit <- lm(mpg~am, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
-->

<!--best_fit <- lm(mpg~am + wt + hp, data = mtcars)
anova(fit, best_fit)
-->

<h2>Model Testing:<h2/>
<!--t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
-->

<h2>Boxplot:<h2/>
<!--boxplot(mpg~am, data = mtcars,col ="blue",
xlab = "Transmission",
ylab = "Miles per Gallon",
main = "MPG by Transmission Type")
-->
<h2>Results:<h2/>
<p>The boxplot indicates that a manual transmission achieve extra miles per gallon compared to automatic transmission.
The t-test output of a p-value: 0.001374 that is less than 0.05. strongly validates the result.<p/>
